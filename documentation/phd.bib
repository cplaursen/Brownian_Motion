  abstract  = {In this chapter, we present an autonomous monitoring robot platform for agricultural farms and fields that is built using low-cost off-the-shelf hardware and open source software so as to be affordable for farmers. We provide a review of the current state of the art in autonomous agricultural robots and summarize the challenges that they must overcome. Our work comprises two main components: (1) the system architecture and hardware selected for a fully autonomous agricultural robot platform for automated monitoring and intervention tasks, and (2) the sensor fusion, local planning, and navigation software based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework with inclusion of design details and testing results. The challenges faced, solutions tested, and successes achieved with respect to the hardware and software architectures for this robot are presented in the interest of guiding future solutions for autonomous agricultural navigation and planning. We evaluate our approaches in outdoor farm field environments as well as indoor environments serving as an analogue for greenhouse navigation, and show how the properties of the environment affect the accuracy of the mapping and localisation tasks.},

In this paper, we describe design and programming of the Beaver micro-rover developed for Northern Light, a Canadian initiative to send a small lander and rover to Mars to study the Martian surface and subsurface. For a small, hardware-limited rover to handle an uncertain and mostly unknown environment without constant management by human operators, we use a Bayesian network of discrete random variables as an abstraction of expert knowledge about the rover and its environment, and inference operations for control. A framework for efficient construction and inference into a Bayesian network using only the C language and fixed-point mathematics on embedded hardware has been developed for the Beaver to make intelligent decisions with minimal sensor data. We study the performance of the Beaver as it probabilistically maps a simple outdoor environment with sensor models that include uncertainty. Results indicate that the Beaver and other small and simple robotic platforms can make use of a Bayesian network to make intelligent decisions in uncertain planetary environments.},

We develop the core theory and verification techniques for Interaction Trees, use them to give a semantics to the CSP and Circus languages, and formally link our new semantics with the failures-divergences semantic model. We also show how the Isabelle code generator can be used to generate verified executable simulations for reactive and concurrent programs.},

Such an integration requires unified semantic foundations for the various notations, and co-ordination of a variety of automated verification tools. The contribution of this paper is Isabelle/UTP, an implementation of Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, a framework for unification of formal semantics. Isabelle/UTP permits the mechanisation of computational theories for diverse paradigms, and their use in constructing formalised semantics. These can be further applied in the development of verification tools, harnessing Isabelle's proof automation facilities. Several layers of mathematical foundations are developed, including lenses to model variables and state spaces as algebraic objects, alphabetised predicates and relations to model programs, algebraic and axiomatic semantics, proof tools for Hoare logic and refinement calculus, and UTP theories to encode computational paradigms.},

    systems. Some applications also have a stochastic
    behavior, however, either because of fundamental
    properties of nature, uncertain environments, or

    probabilistic systems have been studied using logic.
    But logic has been chronically underdeveloped in the
    context of stochastic hybrid systems, i.e., systems
    with interacting discrete, continuous, and stochastic
    dynamics. We aim at overcoming this deficiency and
    introduce a dynamic logic for stochastic hybrid
    systems. Our results indicate that logic is a
    promising tool for understanding stochastic hybrid
    systems and can help taming some of their complexity.
    We introduce a compositional model for stochastic
    hybrid systems. We prove adaptivity, cadlag, and
    Markov time properties, and prove that the semantics
    of our logic is measurable. We present compositional
    proof rules, including rules for stochastic

logic properties whose probability of being true is very small --- rare events. It
is well known that sampling-based (Monte Carlo) techniques, such as statistical model
checking, do not perform well for estimating rare-event probabilities. The problem
is that the sample size required for good accuracy grows too large as the event probability
tends to zero. However, several techniques have been developed to address this problem.
We focus on importance sampling techniques, which bias the original system to compute
highly accurate and efficient estimates. The main difficulty in importance sampling
is to devise a good biasing density, that is, a density yielding a low-variance estimator.
In this paper, we show how to use the cross-entropy method for generating approximately
optimal biasing densities for statistical model checking. We apply the method with
importance sampling and statistical model checking for estimating rare-event probabilities
in stochastic hybrid systems coded as Stateflow/Simulink diagrams.},

  abstract  = {Models are central to engineering. They are used for analysis, synthesis, and communication between humans. A given artifact or process may have multiple models with different purposes, modeling different aspects, or modeling at varying levels of abstraction. In this paper, we give a general overview of how models are used, with the goal of making the concepts clearer for different communities. We focus on the domain of track-based flow management of automated systems, and identify two different modeling styles, Eulerian and Lagrangian. Eulerian models focus on regions of space, whereas Lagrangian models focus on entities moving through space. We discuss how the features of the system, like having centralized or decentralized control or the ability to install fixed infrastructure, influence the choice between these styles. Although the choice between modeling styles is rarely made consciously, it affects modeling efficiency, and one style may be far better suited for certain modeling problems than another. For problems with a more global nature concerning the physical space, an Eulerian model is likely to be a better match. For problems that concern the moving objects specifically, where the identity of the individual objects is important, a Lagrangian view is the one to choose. In many cases, combining the two styles is the most effective approach. We illustrate the two styles using an example of an automated quarry.},

Although CPSs can be found in several real-world domains, their verification often relies on simulation test systems rather than formal methodologies. We propose a hybrid probabilistic process calculus for modelling and reasoning on CPSs. The dynamics of the calculus is expressed in terms of a probabilistic labelled transition system in the SOS style of Plotkin. This is used to define a bisimulation-based probabilistic behavioural semantics which supports compositional reasonings. For a more careful comparison between CPSs, we provide two compositional probabilistic metrics to formalise the notion of behavioural distance between systems, also in the case of bounded computations. Finally, we provide a non-trivial case study, taken from an engineering application, and use it to illustrate our definitions and our compositional behavioural theory for CPSs.},

  abstract   = {Semantics for nondeterministic probabilistic sequential programs has been well studied in the past decades. In a variety of semantic models, how nondeterministic choice interacts with probabilistic choice is the most significant difference. In He, Morgan, and McIver's relational model, probabilistic choice refines nondeterministic choice. This model is general because of its predicative-style semantics in Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, and suitable for automated reasoning because of its algebraic feature. Previously, we gave probabilistic semantics to the RoboChart notation based on this model, and also formalised the proof that the semantic embedding is a homomorphism, and revealed interesting details. In this paper, we present our mechanisation of the proof in Isabelle/UTP enabling automated reasoning for probabilistic sequential programs including a subset of the RoboChart language. With mechanisation, we even reveal more interesting questions, hidden in the original model. We demonstrate several examples, including an example to illustrate the interaction between nondeterministic choice and probabilistic choice, and a RoboChart model for randomisation based on binary probabilistic choice.},

In this chapter, we discuss first why we need probability by surveying how we use it in designing robots. To illustrate our approach, we focus on the verification of probabilistic robotic algorithms for pose estimation. We verify a model-fitting algorithm: random sample consensus (Ransac). This is a popular algorithm, representative of a class of particle-filter algorithms. We analyse the aspects of the algorithm and show how to model-check properties and how to get stronger guarantees using a program logic. Our contributions are a survey of probabilistic robotic applications and an approach to verifying probabilistic algorithms developed using RoboStar technology.},

  abstract   = {In this paper we introduce the problem of reachability analysis of hybrid automata to decide safety properties. Then we describe ARIADNE, an in-progress open environment to design algorithms for computing with hybrid automata. We show that ARIADNE relies on a rigorous computable analysis theory to represent geometric objects, in order to achieve provable approximation bounds along the computations. The proposed tool differs from existing ones because it relies on a sound theoretical basis for the semantics of operators in continuous space and time, making available exact and approximate, but error-bounded operations on geometric points and sets. Currently the geometry module is substantially completed, and work is in progress on the evaluation module. As a first application, we will use ARIADNE to compute the reachable sets of a challenging collection of benchmarks whose safety properties have practical interest.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new method to program robots based on Bayesian inference and learning. It is called BRP for Bayesian Robot Programming. The capacities of this programming method are demonstrated through a succession of increasingly complex experiments. Starting from the learning of simple reactive behaviors, we present instances of behavior combination, sensor fusion, hierarchical behavior composition, situation recognition and temporal sequencing. This series of experiments comprises the steps in the incremental development of a complex robot program. The advantages and drawbacks of BRP are discussed along with these different experiments and summed up as a conclusion. These different robotics programs may be seen as an illustration of probabilistic programming applicable whenever one must deal with problems based on uncertain or incomplete knowledge. The scope of possible applications is obviously much broader than robotics.},

  abstract  = {The pitfalls of naive robot simulations have been recognised for areas such as evolutionary robotics. It has been suggested that carefully validated simulations with a proper treatment of noise may overcome these problems. This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics.},

Then, we provide a formalization of the Cox–Rubinstein model and we show that the market is complete in this model, i.e., that every derivative product admits a replicating portfolio. This entails that in this model, every derivative product admits a unique fair price. In addition, we provide Isabelle functions to compute the fair price of some derivative products.},
